# Project Outline

Our website, ArtWalli, is an interactive website where users can either draw, design, or download thier very own wallpapers.
In the drawing section, users are allowed to use our digital brush and canvas to create whatever design they please. They may save this to their device and use it as their new wallpaper.
For the design section, users have the ability to customize some of our pre-made designs to add a personal touch to their wallpaper. Similar to the drawing section, they may save their creation after to use as a wallpaper.
Lastly, in the download section, users may choose from a number of premade wallpapers. They can download these images for free and use it as a wallpaper. This is not a created webpage but instead a pinterest board made by yours truly.
These wallpapers are available for phones, tablets, and desktops. 

## How JS is incorporated 

We are mostly incorporating JS in the webpages where one can draw and design their own wallpaper.
We will also be using it in the home page to apply smooth-scrolling.
